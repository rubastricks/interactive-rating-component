## Overview 
The goal for this project was to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.I was allowed to use any tool to help me complete the challenge. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating.

### Built with 
- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- CSS
- JS 

### What I learned 
On this challenge I learned how to prevent the form to deafault when it gets submitted, also using the textContent property in JS.
